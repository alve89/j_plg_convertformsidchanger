This plugin intends to automatically replaces a users ID to a Form ID of Joomlas extension Convert Forms.

The workflow is:
- The site visitor clicks on a link to a contact form to directly (!) contact a user (e. g. https://my.site/directcontact?cfid=99&uid=123) where:
    - directcontact is the menu item to a Convert Forms form which runs a PHP-script (see below)
    - cfid is the parameter name to transport the contact form id. It is configurable in this plugin.
	- uid is the parameter name to transport the user id.
    - 99 is the contact form id which is supposed to be used as direct form.
	- 123 is the users id which is supposed to be contacted
- The user is being redirected to this directform
- The PHP script within this form looks up the users id in the database, loads its email address and puts it into an hidden field
- The visitor enters a message to the contact form and the mail gets sent to the hidden fields mail address.

The code which needs to be placed in the Convert Forms contact form:


```
    if(isset($_POST['uid']) && !empty($_POST['uid'])) {
$uid = $_POST['uid'];
			// Get user details from database by given uid

			// Get a db connection.
			$db = JFactory::getDbo();

			// Create a new query object.
			$query = $db->getQuery(true);

			// Select all records from the user profile table where key begins with "custom.".
			// Order it by the ordering field.
			$query->select($db->quoteName('email'));
			$query->from($db->quoteName('#__users'));
			$query->where($db->quoteName('id') . ' = ' . $db->quote($uid));

			// Reset the query using our newly populated query object.
			$db->setQuery($query);

			// Load the results as a list of stdClass objects (see later for more options on retrieving data).
			$results = $db->loadObjectList();

$form['fields']['hidden_addr']['value'] = $results[0]->email;
}
```
